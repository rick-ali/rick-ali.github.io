Equivariant neural networks incorporate symmetries through group actions, embedding them as an inductive bias to improve performance on a wide variety of tasks. However, existing equivariant methods can be computationally intensive, with high parameter counts, and are often tied to a specific architecture. We propose a simple zero-parameter approach that imposes approximate equivariance for a finite group in the latent representation, as an additional term in the loss function. We conduct experiments which allow the network to learn a group representation on the latent space, and show in every case it prefers to learn the regular representation. Fixing this action on the latent space, this yields a simple method to impose approximate equivariance as an additional loss penalty. We benchmark our approach on three datasets and compare it against several existing equivariant methods, showing that in many cases it achieves similar or better performance for a fraction of the parameters.
