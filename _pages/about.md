I am a PhD student at the University of Cambridge, supervised by Prof. Jamie Vicary and Prof. Pietro Liò. My research focuses on understanding the structure in data and their representation in deep learning, with the goal of building more powerful and interpretable AI systems. I study the foundations of representation learning and generalisations of the geometric deep learning framework, drawing on ideas from category theory, the mathematics of structure and compositionality, and information theory.

Before my PhD, I completed an MPhil in Advanced Computer Science at the University of Cambridge, where I took courses in machine learning and category theory. My dissertation, Towards Category-Theoretic Message Passing, investigated category-theoretic and algebraic methods for enabling reasoning and compositionality in graph neural networks.

Prior to that, I obtained a BSc in Mathematics and Computer Science from the University of Manchester, where I studied pure mathematics, machine learning, and theoretical computer science. While at Manchester, I worked with Prof. Gavin Brown on learning theory, using information geometry to formalise the connection (and distinction) between the seminal notions of bias/variance and approximation/estimation.
