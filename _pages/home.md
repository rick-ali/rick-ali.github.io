### Hello!

I'm Riccardo, currently an MPhil student in Advanced Computer Science at the University of Cambridge. <br/><br/>
My main research focus is on Artificial Intelligence, particularly in Geometric Deep Learning.
My dissertation is in Neural Algorithmic Reasoning and algorithmic alignment, where I'm using category theory and abstract algebra to research asynchronous alignment. <br/>
I'm also interested in the geometry of deep learning and natural gradients, as well as theoretical learning theory. <br/><br/>
Generally, I'm interested in whatever can enhance our understanding of machine learning systems!<br/><br/>

<!-- ### About me

I am a physicist working in the field of quantum mechanics and quantum electrodynamics.
I received my undergraduate degree in physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1939 and went on to earn my PhD from Princeton University in 1942.
After completing my doctoral studies, I worked on the Manhattan Project, where I helped develop the first atomic bombs.
After the war, I returned to academia, holding teaching and research positions at Cornell and now the California Institute of Technology. -->
